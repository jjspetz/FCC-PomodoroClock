# FCC-PomodoroClock
This is one of [freecodecamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-pomodoro-clock) advanced front-end projects. 
I built it locally as a change of pace.

I didn't add many bells and whistles after I got it working but you can see it live at [codepen.](http://codepen.io/jjspetz/full/WpWxov/)
