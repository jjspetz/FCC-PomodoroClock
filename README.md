# FCC-PomodoroClock
This is one of [freecodecamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-pomodoro-clock) advanced front-end projects. 
I built it locally as a change of pace.
I didn't add many bells and whistles after I got it working but you can see it live at [codepen.](http://codepen.io/jjspetz/full/WpWxov/)

### Languages/Frameworks
jQuery, HTML5, CSS

### Lesson's Learned
1. How to build an alternating infinite loop. This is used to switch between the session and break time.
2. How to get around some of javascript's floating point inaccuracies.
